Daniel Joseph Gomez is a student of cell and molecular molecular biology at SF State. His research interests include molecular medicine, molecular computing and biotechnology. He leads the CM group, which develops computational systems biology, bioinformatics and gene editing.

He started in Molecular Cell Biology, he was then hired in the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology, and Pharmacology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, John A. Burns School of Medicine. Basic research experience began <i>in vitro</i> culturing these cells neurons, astrocytes, cardiomyocytes. He also processed whole blood and isolated PBMCs for viability assays. In tissue biology, performed immunohistochemistry <i>in situ</i> in mouse brain and kidney to identify HIV-1 and JCPyV proteins and physiological biomarkers. 
Volunteering at UCSD School of Medicine in the Department of Anesthesiology he gained surgical experience in House mouse and culturing and gathering metabolomic data in cardiomyocytes. He was able to perform the Langendorf Apparatus heart surgery independtly while collecting electrode data on somatostatins. 
Recently he has made advances <i> in silico </i> with single-cell transcriptomics such as scRNAseq analysis with spatial data retrieval. Imaging stiching and analysis of spatial datasets were accomplished. The anterior and posterior mouse brain were put together with spatial features, dim plots, violin plots, and gene expression visualizations. 

He's attended well-known conferences like the AIA Immunology 100th Centennial and Experimental Biology (EB). He's able to obtain unique perspectives of physician scientists, fellows, and doctorates of the human body, animal models, and their environment. Overall, he's performed and observed experiments <i> in vivo </i>, <i> in vitro</i>, <i>in situ</i>, <i>ex vivo</i>, and <i>in silico</i>. He has also taught the General Chemistry lab class in the pre-med sequence.
